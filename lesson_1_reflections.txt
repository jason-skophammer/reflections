How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By isolating the differences between the files there was less information
to review, which saved the time it would have taken to search through the
parts that contained no bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I won't have to spend time trying to recreate something I had done before
and later decided to change.  Also, if I make substantial changes to a program
I'll be able to retrieve an earlier (working) version of the program to use in 
case the newer version has bugs and other programs depend upon that one to 
function properly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
